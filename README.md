This Space Invaders game was initially part of an Ania Kub√≥w YouTube walkthrough, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSt2_YZzCec&ab_channel=AniaKub%C3%B3w%23JavaScriptGames

I took this functionality and added a variety of features. The main difference is that the game now has levels, with the difficulty increasing each level, due to the increased speed of moving invaders. I achieved this by adding various functions and refactoring parts of the initial code.

I also altered the code so that it would work on the click of the play button as oppose to upon the loading of the webpage. I then used a space invader font I found online, and some CSS to completely redesign the layout.

This project was created via JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

In future, an additional feature I may add is a highscore, which would require each taking player's details and keeping track of the three highest scores over a set time period.
